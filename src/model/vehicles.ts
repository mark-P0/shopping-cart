The 8C also has the beast to back up the beauty, using a version of the 4.3-liter V8 that sees duty in the Maserati Coupe and the Ferrari F430, and is precisely balanced with a 6-speed transaxle mounted just ahead of the rear wheels. Keeping all the weight inside the wheelbase allows the 8C to dance with the finest corner-carvers around, and it can hold its own at a stoplight drag by handily laying down 12.4-second quarter miles. Of course, with those looks, a simple cruise down the boulevard will rack up double-takes without needing to even let the 8C\u2019s 450 horsepower sing its warbling quad-exhaust note.",

The MiTo not only wears Alfa\u2019s corporate shield well, it also does the marque\u2019s illustrious history of sporting cars justice by coaxing 153 horsepower out of a 1.4-liter engine through the use of a turbocharger. It provides a nice fat torque curve, so no waiting around while the turbo spools up to unleash its full potential.

Sure it\u2019s street legal, but the Atom is at home at the track or even the drag strip. Ariel claims 0-60 acceleration to be 2.3 seconds. Few motorcycles can even match those numbers; it follows, since Ariel used to build some of the most loved British bikes in history. Here are just a few of the mind-blowing specs that make the Atom 500 what it is: a John Hartley-designed 500 horsepower Ariel 3.0 liter, weighing in at 198 pounds, a Sadev six-speed sequential transmission, Dymag magnesium wheels, combined with its exo-skeleton chassis with carbon fiber body panels and foils the Atom weighs in at a phenomenal 1,213 pounds.

The DB9 manages to turn these modern accoutrements into a classic GT driving experience, although the performance numbers would make any actual classic Aston blush, as 60 mph comes in a blistering 4.7 seconds. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the lines of the car, penned by the legendary designers Ian Callum and Henrik Fisker, are stunningly gorgeous from any angle.

Only James Bond could survive the resulting cartwheeling crash that utterly destroyed the svelte coupe. It was a shame the Aston had to take one on the chin, because the DBS is one of the most beautiful cars on the road. In the grand Aston Martin tradition, the extremely limited-production DBS combines an unparalleled handcrafted interior with serious performance credentials. In case you didn\u2019t think the DBS was unique enough already, the key fob is topped with polished stainless steel and finished with sapphire crystals.

How many autos do you need to do all of these things? Just one: the Audi Q7 V12 TDI. The German automaker has always been on the forefront of engineering excellence, introducing the quattro all-wheel drive system that rewrote motorsports history, and the Q7\u2019s V12 TDI is a masterpiece of engineering drawing from Audi\u2019s improbable success racing at Le Mans with diesel prototypes. Thankfully the Q7 utilizes that quattro system to put the power down, because TopGear host Jeremy Clarkson rightly points out that the gargantuan 738 ft-lbs. of torque is \u201cenough to restart a dead planet.\u201d If you only could have one vehicle to do everything with, you\u2019d be hard pressed to pick a better candidate than the all-conquering Q7.",

The TT took the world by storm with its unique style (dubbed \u201cbauhaus\u201d by the press) and performance credentials, and the new TT RS is all this and more. The turbocharged inline-five takes Audi back to its rally roots (the original Quattro Sport used the same configuration to decimate the competition in the 1980s). It\u2019s no retro tribute, however, as this all-wheel drive stunner is stuffed to the gills with modern engine tech like direct injection, and sports a cylinder head borrowed from the Lamborghini Gallardo. It\u2019s a total package that makes the coupe scoot: 60 mph is dispatched in an exotic 4.5 seconds with a distinctive snarl from the 2.5-liter motor. The first TT to wear the storied RS badge, the TT RS caries over several RS trademarks like the enormous oval twin exhaust tips and larger front intakes, which complement the sporty dimensions of the coupe. With handling worthy of any of Audi\u2019s RS models, the TT RS is most at home on a highly technical track.",

The basic design of the Superlight R500 are the bones of the Lotus 7 which has existed in a mostly unaltered form for more than 50 years. Sure, there have been evolutions in materials, tweaks to dimensions, and the old live-axle rear suspension has long been replaced by a De Dion rear axle.

Caterham purchased the rights to the Lotus 7 in 1973 and has since been \u201csimplifying and adding lightness\u201d as Chapman prophesized so long ago. The Superlight R500 represents a weapons-grade thrill car that can deliver breathtaking performance anywhere it\u2019s required.

Only nine were built as RHD, but every one was slightly unique as all were hand made, and purpose built. The created controversy initially as the racing competition claimed it was a new car while Ferrari argued it was just an update from the earlier homologated 250 GT. Ferrari won the argument and the initial name of 250 GT/Comp became 250 GTO with the O\" for Omologato (Homologation in Italian). In their first race, the 1962 Sebring 12 Hours, they won the GT class then followed it up with a class win at Le Mans and just about every race they entered.

    "description": "For Ferrari\u2019s top-of-the-line two-seater to be named after their own private racetrack, used for testing Ferrari\u2019s F1 cars, it has to be pretty special. The Frank Stephenson-penned lines recall the F430 he also designed, and convey that this big, bold Ferrari shouldn\u2019t be ignored. That\u2019s particularly true when you consider that it\u2019s faster to 60 mph than the mighty Enzo despite weighing nearly 700 lbs. more, can exceed 200 mph, and still can swaddle you and a friend in the butteriest leather this side of Connolly\u2014that is, it can do all this if you can afford to purchase one. The 599 GTB may not be cheap, but what it lacks in bargain-basement pricing it more than makes up for in performance and atmosphere: you can revel in the V12\u2019s gruff bark or bang out shifts based on the shift indicator lights on the steering wheel (accurately modeled in-game, by the way). The 599 is a triumph of engineering, showing that a front-engine V12-powered grand tourer doesn\u2019t have to make many compromises in this day and age.",

    "description": "Gran turismo omologata--it means certified for grand touring racing\" in Italian, and Ferrari doesn't use that designation lightly. When the 599 GTB went in for the GTO treatment, they had only to look to the decidedly not-street-legal 599XX version for inspiration. The result is a lighter, more powerful 599 that carries on Ferrari's long tradition of using racing to pioneer technology for road cars. Following the formula of the legendary 250 GTO of the 1960s, this hotter version of Ferrari's halo car puts a 6-liter V12 out front that delivers a tarmac-blistering 670 horsepower, making the 599 GTO not only the most powerful Ferrari road car ever, but also the fastest. That's not just the fastest to 60 miles per hour; it also means that by cutting more than 200 pounds from the GTB and optimizing every system\u2014from the instantly adjustable magnetic suspension system to the lightweight carbon ceramic brakes\u2014it will fly around Ferrari's private Fiorano test track a full second quicker than the wickedly fast Enzo. With lessons learned from Ferrari's F1 program, the 599 GTO's optimized aerodynamics ensure that the 599 GTO can achieve a top speed of 208 miles per hour, and yet the intelligent suspension and the stability and traction control systems mean that the GTO won't bite the hand that shifts. With only 599 examples ever produced, the flagship Ferrari is as rare as it is fast.\"",

That\u2019s because, like all \u201cXX\u201d cars, Scuderia Ferrari holds onto the car for owners, maintaining and storing them, so all that owners have to do is show up at the track, strap in (very tightly, for their sake), and let the 599XX loose. While based on the 599 GTB Fiorano, there have been so many changes to bring it to XX specification that it\u2019s impossible to list them all. For example, except the roof, every other body panel has been altered to help with aerodynamics or allow more cooling air to the brakes or engine. Speaking of the engine, meticulously precise construction and an exhaust system that doesn\u2019t have to consider road-going requirements allow the 6-liter V12 to produce 108 more horsepower than its GTB stablemate, allowing the 599XX to accelerate to 100 mph in less than 6 seconds. For the steep entry price and ownership limitations, one thing you don\u2019t get is taillights\u2014those were deleted in favor of exhaust outlets for the active fans that suck air out from under the car below 155 mph. Over that speed, the additional downforce isn\u2019t needed.",

(Interestingly, Scaglietti is no longer in the design business, so former rival Pininfarina penned the bodywork as a tribute to their comrade.) Like Sergio Scaglietti\u2019s most famous design, the 250 SWB, his namesake car is a front-engine, rear-drive coupe powered by a large-bore V12\u2014in this case, a 5.7-liter unit. Unlike its predecessor, and indeed unlike any Ferrari previously, the 612 is constructed entirely from aluminum, using the lightweight metal for the space frame chassis as well as the bodywork. Ferrari engineers also pushed the wheels way out to the corners, and moved the engine back in the chassis, for better weight balance. Even though the 612 is a big 2+2 grand tourer, it doesn\u2019t feel so large behind the wheel, retaining a nimbleness that\u2019s characteristic of modern front-engine Ferraris despite its seeming bulk. Few people deserve such an honor, and the 612 is proof that Scaglietti certainly does.",

Without any of that background, however, the Dino could easily stand alone. The 246 GT\u2019s immediate predecessor, the 206, was conservative-minded Ferrari\u2019s first mid-engine road car and the beginning of a trend that even the reluctant Enzo couldn\u2019t stifle\u2014particularly with styling partner Pininfarina pushing him in that direction (Pininfarina also penned the Dino\u2019s graceful lines). It was also the first Ferrari to use less than 12 cylinders. In the 246 GT\u2019s case, it\u2019s a sweet-sounding V6 that was Dino\u2019s legacy\u2014before Dino passed away, he worked with famed engineer Vittorio Jano on the advanced engine that would ultimately be produced in various forms for almost 40 years. Because the 246 GT was significantly smaller and lighter than other Ferrari models, the 2.4-liter motor\u2019s 195 horsepower makes the baby Ferrari fairly quick. However, a straight line isn\u2019t the best way to experience the 246 GT, because it truly excels is in spirited driving where the mid-engine placement can show off its superior handling characteristics. It won\u2019t take long to understand why Enzo changed his mind about the 246 GT\u2019s layout, and even named it after his beloved son.",

The result was that Jaguar was swamped with more orders than they could fill. In retrospect, that\u2019s not surprising, because for the equivalent of the price of a mid-level executive sedan, buyers of the E-type were treated to what was essentially a supercar by the standards of the time. A complicated new fully independent rear suspension makes the E-type quite nimble (it was so successful that Jaguar used the design for decades), and the powerful 3.8-liter inline six makes the coupe considerably faster than contemporary car in its price range. The original E-type, the S1, became an enduring symbol of the zenith of the British auto industry, and one of the most iconic Jaguars ever.

Of all that have made it past the drawing board into production, few are as good as the Grand Cherokee SRT8. Perhaps that\u2019s not surprising\u2014the original Grand Cherokee was a seriously fast vehicle, and not just for an SUV. So when the SRT team set to work on the third generation vehicle, the groundwork was already there. In addition, they had access to the 6.1-liter Hemi, one of the greatest modern performance engines around and a staple of the SRT lineup. Now, it\u2019s easy to imagine the Grand Cherokee SRT8 as a one-trick pony, quick in a straight line but bumbling in a corner. While the speed is certainly there (60 mph flashes by in less than five seconds), the Jeep\u2019s likely to surprise you when the going gets twisty, because their engineers massaged the suspension, fitted much larger brakes, and stuffed massive rubber under the already arched fenders. And with the revised front air dam and the rear bumper (sporting massive center-exit exhaust pipes), no one\u2019s going to mistake this for a normal SUV.",

As attractive as the body shell, resembling the W194 racer that inspired it, it\u2019s what\u2019s under the skin that makes the 300SL so groundbreaking. The 3-liter inline six cylinder engine, while related to the unit in the large Type 300 sedan, benefitted from the development it saw in action in the W194, and sported a new cylinder head and mechanical fuel injection to produce more than 240 horsepower in road-going trim. Like the racer, the Gullwing also utilized tube-frame construction, part of which passed through where conventional doors would go, which explains the distinctive door arrangement. The \u201cSL\u201d part of the name stands for \u201cSport Leicht,\u201d or \u201csport light,\u201d and the regular Gullwing was very light\u2014but it could be made lighter by ordering the optional aluminum alloy body for a substantial fee.

Actually, make that two purposes, because if you blast through a few corners to get the brakes heated up, you\u2019ll notice the turbine-inspired alloy wheels illuminated by the orange glow of superheated carbon-ceramic brake rotors that are capable of hauling the SLR down from astonishing speeds without fading. Crack a window to listen to the shriek of the twin-rotor supercharger feeding cold air to the big V8, and then close it to cruise in sporting comfort.

    "description": "The Z-car formula has never been complicated. All it takes is a lusty six cylinder tucked under a long hood, with power going to the rear in the way Mr. K, father of the original 240Z, intended. The 370Z improves on this recipe for success by being smaller, lighter, wider, and more powerful than the 350Z that came before, incorporating new, lightweight aluminum body panels and a larger 3.7-liter V6. It also is the first car in the world to debut a nifty piece of new technology\u2014SynchroRev Match, which automatically blips the throttle on downshifts for perfect rev-matching every time. One look at the 370Z\u2019s tighter lines, featherweight forged wheels, and the menacing sharks\u2019 tooth head- and taillights will tell you that the new Z is a thoroughly modern driver\u2019s dream with a legendary name. It\u2019s also the perfect canvass to create a custom drift monster: try swapping in the Skyline\u2019s twin-turbo inline six and perfecting your drift technique.",

    "description": "As the penultimate edition of the \u201cR34\u201d series Skyline GT-R, and in fact, as one of the last of the traditionally inline-six powered Skylines, the V-Spec II is destined to be a collectible. Let\u2019s hope that this doesn\u2019t mean that existing models are parked in garages and never driven, because driving is exactly what Nissan intended this GT-R to do. The V-Spec II (the \u201cV\u201d stands for \u201cvictory,\u201d by the way) comes with all of the goodies that the original V-Spec had, but it\u2019s even harder-edged thanks to increased stiffness and lighter weight (primarily due to a special carbon fiber hood, spotted at a distance by the small NACA duct). The RB26DETT engine will be familiar to Skyline fans, but only the very fanatical will know offhand that the ATTESA E-TS all-wheel drive system is actually the \u201cPro\u201d version, with an active limited-slip differential that splits torque laterally if necessary. Externally, small \u201cV-Spec II\u201d badges and a large \u201cbi-plane\u201d rear wing differentiate this Skyline from lesser models. With well over 300 horsepower, the GT-R is not only quick, it\u2019s very much so\u2014particularly in poor traction situations where the all-wheel drive system comes into the fore.",

Starting with the traditional body-in-white, RUF completely rebuilds or replaces the rest of the componentry, and the result is stunning\u2014730 horsepower and 693 ft-lbs. of torque, enough to rival all but the most extreme supercars. Partially that\u2019s due to the 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged \u201cboxer\u201d six, and partly that\u2019s due to the nearly supernatural ability of the R to translate that power into forward momentum using the all-wheel drive system. 0-60 times are nearly irrelevant; they\u2019re in the low 3-second range, or in other words, rocket-ship quick. The limits of adhesion are nearly impossible to reach on a regular road\u2014it takes a serious roadcourse to take the R to its limits. That the R is capable of being registered for road use (in some parts of Europe, at least), is perhaps the strangest part of the equation considering its manic performance. It should be noted, though, that while the R can do things that few cars can equal, it does so precisely and without drama; a skilled driver can use this car as a finely tuned racing tool.",

With enough room to run and a heavy throttle, the S7 launches hard and gathers up speed surprisingly quickly\u2014even if you expect that with 575 horsepower it should take off in a hurry, the raw and unrestrained acceleration is staggering (the quarter mile is decimated in just under 12 seconds at 120 mph). While it looks fast, it\u2019s also huge\u2014no other two-seat car offered at the time is so long or wide. That size doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the S7 packs a lot of weight, as it utilizes an expensive mix of carbon fiber and aluminum honeycomb materials to keep mass down. Trick suspension is relatively soft at low speeds for additional comfort, but firms up when the S7\u2019s downforce hunkers the car down at speed. It\u2019s a combination that in race trim as the S7R has been very successful in sportscar racing. Overkill for the street, perhaps, but there are few cars as ferociously rewarding to drive on a track than the S7.",

TVRs have always marched to the manic beat of a different drummer, and the Sagaris fits the mold by being just as wild and untamed as its almost comically aggressive looks suggest. Yet it\u2019s also one of the most balanced TVRs ever made, which is more a statement about how unruly Blackpool\u2019s previous models have been. Step inside its alien-spacepod interior and fire up TVR\u2019s own 4-liter inline six, which TVR cryptically says makes \u201cthree-hundred-and-a-lot\u201d horsepower, and prepare for the fury. Since the Sagaris weighs next to nothing with a fiberglass body and diminutive proportions, the big six is enough to dispatch cars with twice as many cylinders.
